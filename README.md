# Slider-Z-index
This is one of my first published scripts during jQuery learning.
This slider is really simple and light,may be used without any photos,it's working with slide opacity and z-index.

Here u can try this script: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/WilhelmTim/Slider-Z-index/blob/master/index.html
